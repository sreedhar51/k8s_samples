kubernetes upgrade

ubeadm allows us to upgrade our cluster components in the proper order, making sure to include important feature upgrades we might want to take advantage of in the latest stable version of Kubernertes. In this lesson, we will go through upgrading our cluster from version 1.13.5 to 1.14.1.

View the version of the server and client on the master node:

kubectl version --short
View the version of the scheduler and controller manager:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system kube-controller-manager-chadcrowell1c.mylabserver.com -o yaml
View the name of the kube-controller pod:

kubectl get pods -n kube-system
Set the VERSION variable to the latest stable release of Kubernetes:

export VERSION=v1.14.1
Set the ARCH variable to the amd64 system:

export ARCH=amd64
View the latest stable version of Kubernetes using the variable:

echo $VERSION
Curl the latest stable version of Kubernetes:

curl -sSL https://dl.k8s.io/release/${VERSION}/bin/linux/${ARCH}/kubeadm > kubeadm
Install the latest version of kubeadm:

sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 ./kubeadm /usr/bin/kubeadm
Check the version of kubeadm:

sudo kubeadm version
Plan the upgrade:

sudo kubeadm upgrade plan
Apply the upgrade to 1.14.1:

kubeadm upgrade apply v1.14.1
View the differences between the old and new manifests:

diff kube-controller-manager.yaml /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
Curl the latest version of kubelet:

curl -sSL https://dl.k8s.io/release/${VERSION}/bin/linux/${ARCH}/kubelet > kubelet
Install the latest version of kubelet:

sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 ./kubelet /usr/bin/kubelet
Restart the kubelet service:

sudo systemctl restart kubelet.service
Watch the nodes as they change version:

kubectl get nodes -w


When we need to take a node down for maintenance, Kubernetes makes it easy to evict the pods on that node, take it down, and then continue scheduling pods after the maintenance is complete. Furthermore, if the node needs to be decommissioned, you can just as easily remove the node and replace it with a new one, joining it to the cluster.

See which pods are running on which nodes:

kubectl get pods -o wide
Evict the pods on a node:

kubectl drain [node_name] --ignore-daemonsets
Watch as the node changes status:

kubectl get nodes -w
Schedule pods to the node after maintenance is complete:

kubectl uncordon [node_name]
Remove a node from the cluster:

kubectl delete node [node_name]
Generate a new token:

sudo kubeadm token generate
List the tokens:

sudo kubeadm token list
Print the kubeadm join command to join a node to the cluster:

sudo kubeadm token create [token_name] --ttl 2h --print-join-command
